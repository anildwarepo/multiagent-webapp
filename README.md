# Multiagent ChatBot using LLMs
This repo uses [autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) for orchestrating user conversation across multiple agents. 
This reduces implementation complexists as the inter agent communication is handled by autogen using prompts. 

This repo creates a chatbot for a use case where a user can ask questions about a company or a data analysis question or about a product user guide. The chatbot internally orchestrates the conversation across multiple agents and returns the response to the user as shown below.
